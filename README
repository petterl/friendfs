PREREQ:
The fuserl c driver has to be installed. You can find it here:
http://fuserl.googlecode.com/files/fuserldrv-2.0.3.tar.gz

If you are have root just follow the instructions and install it in the
default location. If you are not root or want to install the c driver
someplace else you need to update
lib/fuserl-2.0.5/src/fuserl.appSrc. The thing you need to change is
fuserldrvprefix from auto_detect to the path where you have the fuserl
c driver installed:

i.e. 
{env,[{fuserldrvprefix,"/home/lukas/fuserlcdrv/"}]}

INSTALL:
Just doing a make should be enough to install the system

make 

STARTING FRIENDFS:

First you need to configure friendfs
copy friendfs/doc/friendfs.conf.example to a good place

Set FRIENDFS_CONF to the path to the updated config file
If you put it as /etc/friendfs.conf or $HOME/.friendfs.conf
you dont need to set the FRIENDFS_CONF.

You then can start and connect to the erlang VM using the command:

scripts/friendfsctl start

USING FRIENDFS:

You wont have any fun without a mount point where you can put your
files. You create a mountpoint with:

scripts/friendfsctl mount <mountpoint> <options>

<options> is fs=<filesystem>

remember that /dir/to/mount/to has to exist before you can mount you
new friendfs filesystem into it!

You connect to the erlang VM by issuing this command:

scripts/friendfsctl shell

If you have any question rtfs!
